# Binary Knapsack Problem

*binaryKnapsack* function in *binaryKnapsack.cpp* solves the **Binary Knapsack Problem** by dynamic programming approach. Also, a main function is provided in the file.

# Longest Common Sequence

*longestCommonSequence* function in *longestCommonSequence.cpp* files solves the  **Longest Common Sequence** problem by using dynamic programming approach. It returns the length of longest common subsequence of given two strings. Also, a main function is provided in the file.

# Matrix Chain Multiplication

*matrixChainProduct* function in *matrixChainProduct.cpp* files solves the  **Matrix Chain Multiplication** problem by using dynamic programming approach. It returns minimum number of multiplications. Also, a main function is provided in the file.

# Calculating the Wasted Area with given partition options

There are three functions that calculates the wasted area in a field by partitioning it with given partition options.
The first function is implemented recursively. 
The second one is more optimized version of the first, by storing certain wasted areas calculated before and then using these pre-calculated values, using memoization technique.
The third function is implemented by using dynamic programming approach. It calculates the wasted area for smaller fields and stores them to use in further steps.
Complexities of the second and the third functions is same but, the dynamic programming approach is more efficient by constants.
Also, the first and the second function traces how many times they are called and the third function counts the number of iterations executed.
To run this functions, *main.cpp* will be provided soon.
